            <p class="card-text">As a child the Hero of Time grew up in the Kokiri Forest believing that he was a Kokiri, but in reality he was an orphaned Hylian. Because the Hero of Time 
was not a Kokiri, he did not possess a Fairy companion, which led to him being ostracized by the majority of the Kokiri Forest, with the exception of Saria 
and the Deku Tree. Eventually, the Hero of Time was bestowed with a fairy named Navi by the Deku Tree to help guide him on his quest to save Hyrule.

This boy who we come to know as Link, unwittingly assists a Princess Zelda and a scheming Ganondorf in opening the Door of Time. After retrieving the Master Sword from the Pedestal of Time he was locked in the Sacred Realm for 7 years. Just long enough for him to be able to wield the most mighty weapon outside of Marvel comics. He rises to the call of the Seven Sages and takes his title of Hero of Time.

With Hyrule now at peace, Princess Zelda uses her power as a Sage to send the Hero of Time back to his own age in order to regain his lost childhood.[17] Upon his departure, the Triforce of Courage splits apart into eight shards and are scattered across the land to be found again one day by another Hero that would have need of its power.[18] The Master Sword is also left in the Hero's wake, being returned to its pedestal in turn. With this act, the Hero of Time vanishes from this branch of Hyrule's history, leaving only his legend behind. </p>

            <p class="card-text">efore leaving the land of Hyrule, the Hero of Time warns Princess Zelda about Ganondorf's plans and what the future would unfold if the King of Evil was not stopped.[19] The princess entrusts Link with the Ocarina of Time to prevent Ganondorf from entering the Sacred Realm, and the young hero then departs from Hyrule with the ocarina in hand to seek his fairy companion, Navi. In the process, however, he stumbles into a parallel universe known as Termina, which was being threatened to be destroyed by its Moon. With the aid of the Ocarina of Time and the fairy Tatl, Link saves Termina from its imminent downfall and soon after leaves the land.

Despite this, the Hero of Time continued to lament the fact that he was not remembered as a hero after he was returned to his original time upon defeating 
Ganon.[20] After his death, he was unable to go to the afterlife because of the regrets that kept him tied to the world of the living, feeling regret that 
he was unable to pass on the lessons of his life to the younger generations. In order to ease his regrets and finally pass on his knowledge, he teaches the 
seven Hidden Skills to his descendant, the Link of Twilight Princess.</p>

In the World of Light, he could redeem himself.

Equipped with his trusty tunic and Phrygian cap, he has everything he needs to take down the Master Hand and then some.</p>
