As a child the Hero of Time grew up in the Kokiri Forest believing that he was a Kokiri, but in reality he was an orphaned Hylian. Because the Hero of Time was not a Kokiri, he did not possess 
a Fairy companion, which led to him being ostracized by the majority of the Kokiri Forest, with the exception of Saria and the Deku Tree. Eventually, the Hero of Time was bestowed with a fairy 
named Navi by the Deku Tree to help guide him on his quest to save Hyrule.
