Legacy

The Hero of Time is the title given to the Link who appears in Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask and later in Twilight Princess as the Ancient Hero.[1] Link 
is bestowed this title upon awakening from his seven-year slumber after retrieving the Master Sword from the Pedestal of Time.[1] By traveling through time 
to awaken the Six Sages and stop the King of Evil Ganondorf from conquering Hyrule, the Hero of Time's tale becomes a legend that is passed down through 
generations, proving to be of great relevance to both the Mythology in The Legend of Zelda series as well as the timeline in which the games take place.

The legend of the Hero of Time becomes of great significance in the development of the Zelda Timeline and the mythology in The Legend of Zelda series. His battle against Ganondorf marked the point in which the timeline split into three branches: the Downfall, Child, and Adult Timeline. Princess Zelda's plan with Link to save Hyrule by retrieving the Triforce resulted in Ganondorf obtaining the Triforce of Power,[22] leading eventually, in one continuity, to Link's defeat and the formation of the Downfall Timeline.[23] In the alternate continuity where Link succeeds in defeating Ganondorf, the princess sends the Hero of Time back to his original time, creating two timelines; the Child Timeline and the Adult Timeline.

In the latter of the two, the Triforce of Courage is shattered and the hero in the Adult Timeline vanishes, resulting in Hyrule eventually being flooded since there was no hero to defeat Ganon once the Sages' seal broke.[24] In the Child Timeline, the Hero of Time becomes filled with regret by not being remembered as the hero that saved Hyrule from Ganondorf, eventually leading him to linger on as the Ancient Hero in the Era of Twilight.[20]

Although Hyrule was flooded in the Adult Timeline and the memory of the kingdom vanished, the legend of the Hero of Time transcended through time. In 
Outset Island, it became a custom to clothe boys in green once they came of age.[25][26] A statue depicting the Hero of Time is also prominently displayed 
in the sunken Hyrule Castle, demonstrating how meaningful the legend of the brave boy clothed in green was to the citizens of Hyrule.

Although I accepted life as the hero, I could not convey the lessons of that life to those that came after. At last, I have eased my regrets. - The Hero's Spirit (Twilight Princess)
